Properly classifying and securing Contoso data is the responsibility of every employee and supplier/external staff.

## New sensitivity labels
The following data sensitivity labels were adopted by Contoso in September 2018. Keep reading for an overview, or refer to the Data Classification Standard for additional detail.

### The four sensitivity labels
#### Public
To be used for business data specifically prepared and approved for public consumption.

Examples:
* Marketing materials created for public product releases
* Published financial information
* Materials used for presentations at open conferences, seminars, and podcasts

#### General
To be used for business data which is not meant for public consumption. However, this can be shared with internal employees, business guests and external partners as needed.

Examples:
* Company-wide announcements and information that all employees, stff, and those under NDA have been approved to read.

#### Confidential
To be used on sensitive business data which could cause business harm if over-shared. Data is protected using encryption

Examples:
* Unreleased marketing plans, release schedules, or planned product features
* Source code or binaries
* Product documentation and supporting materials
* Non-Highly Confidential data that is subject to breach notification laws
* Data about Contoso employees
* Customer support tickets
* Customer system diagnostic data

#### Highly Confidential
To be used on very sensitive business data which would certainly cause business harm if over-shared. Data is protected using encryption. Access is restricted to Senior Leadership Team

Examples:
* Pre-release financial results
* Data under strict regulatory handling requirements
* Contoso business secrets
